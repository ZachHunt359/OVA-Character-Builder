      "description": "You have the unfortunate tendency to forget things at inopportune times. At Level 1, tasks you are supposed to do often slip your mind, such as attending important meetings or doing your homework. At Level 2, you have trouble recalling recent conversations and events, and even when you do remember, the details often escape you. At Level 3, you have the memory of a goldfish, making the world a practical blank past five minutes ago. You usually don’t remember anything very long, and sometimes get lost while you are speaking or forget what you are doing while you’re doing it."
