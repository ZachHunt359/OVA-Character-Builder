      "description": "Your body is guarded from potential harm. The exact form this protection takes could be anything, whether it’s a reinforced combat suit, a high-tech force field, or just a really thick hide. For every Level you have in Armored, you may reduce the Damage Multiplier of any attack made to you by 1. If the Damage Multiplier would be reduced to zero or below, reduce it to ½ instead. In situations where the Level in Armored far exceeds the Damage Multiplier, the Game Master may choose to nullify the attack outright. Braun trying to brawl with a giant robot is not likely to achieve any results, and it is well within the GM’s right to make it ridiculously ineffective."
